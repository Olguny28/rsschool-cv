### About me:
I'm a process engineer, but for the last 12 years I've been a balloon designer.
It so happened that I was forced to look for a profession that would allow me to work from home.
With pleasure, I have mastered website design, graphic design and the basics of HTML/CSS.
And I was very interested in web development, because this occupation provides endless opportunities for professional development.
I started my self-education in RSS.
I am sure that my abilities and desire for training will allow me to become an experienced Frontend Developer.
